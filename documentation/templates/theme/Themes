As a customer and business leader, I want to receive early and continuous delivery of valuable software that meets 
my evolving needs, maximizes efficiency and productivity, and provides a competitive advantage. By welcoming changing 
requirements, harnessing them for my advantage, and prioritizing simplicity, we can deliver working software frequently 
within a short timeframe. Following agile principles, we can build self-organizing teams that focus on technical excellence, 
good design, and sustainable development. Through this initiative, we aim to create a high-performing team that delivers successful projects 
and software that exceeds customer expectations and maximizes the return on investment for the business.
